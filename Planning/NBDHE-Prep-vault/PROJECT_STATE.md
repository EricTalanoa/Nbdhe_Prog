## One-liner
A web + installable-PWA NBDHE prep app: full 2026 blueprint coverage, practice + timed mock
exams + cases + analytics, easy to use. Primary user: my girlfriend (accounts + backend so
progress syncs across her devices).

## Current phase
**Phase 5 — Cases & testlets: 5a-cases merged (2026-07-12), PR #10.** `cases`/`testlets`/
`case_media` tables exist (RLS matching other content tables) with `questions.case_id`/
`testlet_id` now real FKs. The vault import pipeline parses `case-*.md` notes and resolves a
question's `case: <slug>` frontmatter into `case_id`, validated offline in `content:check`. A
read-only `PatientBox` component + `/cases` and `/cases/[slug]` pages are live (auth-gated,
linked from the dashboard). One original sample case (`case-perio-0001`, Rule 0) with two linked
items is authored. **Not yet done:** wiring case items into the actual practice/study loop —
that's 5b-case-nav, next up. Migration `20260712000002_cases_testlets.sql` still needs a manual
apply to the live project (see PR #10), then `npm run content:import` to seed the sample case.

Phase 4 (analytics + readiness) is complete: `/analytics` computes, from the user's `responses`
joined through `questions.taxonomy_id → taxonomy.score_area`: overall accuracy, a weakest-areas
ranking, a per-score-area readiness band (Not yet / Approaching / Ready) with coverage % + recent
accuracy, "Study next" suggestions that deep-link into a filtered practice set, and a per-day
accuracy trend — all dependency-free CSS. Readiness thresholds are tunable in `lib/readiness.ts`.
Phase 3 is complete: `/practice/build` (area/difficulty/N/time-limit) plus
`/practice?mode=missed|flagged` review queues and `/practice?t=<secs>` timed tests. Phase 1
(content) and Phase 2 (renderer + session/response tracking) are confirmed working against the live
Supabase project (`NBDHE-Prep`, `otqwhkfhjhixzjtaxhzk`):
- Both pending migrations (`..._seed_taxonomy.sql`, `..._sessions_responses.sql`) are applied.
- `npm run content:import` ran against the live project: `questions` (33), `options` (132),
  `rationales` (33), `taxonomy` (60) all populated from `02-Content/q-*.md`.
- The Vercel production deployment is built from `main` @ `820661a` (`nbdhe-prog.vercel.app`).
  `/questions` and `/practice` are live and correctly auth-gate (redirect to `/login`).
- A real practice run persisted: a `sessions` row (kind `practice`, `finished_at` +
  `score_summary` set) with a matching `responses` row — confirming the owner-only RLS write
  path works end-to-end on the deployed app, not just in code.
- Content triage done (2026-07-12): all 33 authored items reviewed for accuracy + Rule 0 and
  promoted `review` → `approved` (frontmatter + live `questions.status`), so `/practice` now
  draws from the full 33-question bank instead of a set of 1.
- Not yet applied to the live project: `20260712000002_cases_testlets.sql` (PR #10) and the
  2 new case-linked questions + 1 case it adds to the vault (35 questions / 1 case pending import).

## Next 3 actions
1. Apply `20260712000002_cases_testlets.sql` to the live project, run `npm run content:import`
   to seed `case-perio-0001` + its 2 linked items, then smoke-test `/cases` on the deployed URL.
2. Next chunk: **5b-case-nav** — case navigation (parent stimulus + linked child items); wire
   case items into the practice loop so a case can actually be played end-to-end.
3. Phase 7b (ongoing): deepen the bank beyond one item per area — Local Anesthesia and the
   high-item-count clinical areas (Care Planning, Perio Management) get the most depth. Current
   spread is thin (e.g. difficulty is 9 easy / 25 medium / 1 hard across 35 items).

## Stack (decided)
- Frontend: Next.js 14 App Router · TypeScript · Tailwind · shadcn/ui · PWA (manifest + SW)
- Backend: Supabase (Postgres + Auth + Storage), Row-Level Security per user
- Host: Vercel (frontend) + Supabase cloud
- Content: original questions authored to blueprint (see authoring guidelines) — NO real exam items

## Key constraints (do not break)
- **Integrity/copyright: all questions ORIGINAL.** Never use remembered/real NBDHE items.
  Sharing real items violates JCNDE rules of conduct — protects me and her. Non-negotiable.
- Target the **2026 "After Update" test specs** (Local Anesthesia broken out; update ~Oct 2026).
- Local-first feel but real accounts: offline study should work, sync when online.

- Board: 03-Kanban/board.md · Dashboards: 04-Dashboards/

## Decisions (locked)
- **Auth: magic link** (Supabase email OTP) — simplest for her, no password to manage.
- **Readiness: per-area % + a band** (Not yet / Approaching / Ready). No fake 49–99 scale number.
- **Perio charts: static images for MVP**, interactive charting deferred to Phase 7+.
- (Any of these can change — update here first, then the affected code.)

## Open questions
- None blocking Phase 0. Revisit readiness thresholds once real response data exists.
