# PROJECT_STATE — NBDHE Prep

## One-liner
A web + installable-PWA NBDHE prep app: full 2026 blueprint coverage, practice + timed mock
exams + cases + analytics, easy to use. Primary user: my girlfriend (accounts + backend so
progress syncs across her devices).

## Current phase
**Phase 0 — Foundation.** Code complete: Next.js 14 scaffold, shadcn/ui, magic-link auth,
protected dashboard, SQL migrations (profiles + content stubs, RLS on). Awaiting manual steps:
Supabase project keys, run migrations, auth redirect config, Vercel connect. Exit criterion
(sign in on deployed URL) not yet verified.

## Next 3 actions
1. Manual: create Supabase project, put keys in `.env.local` + Vercel, run the two migrations,
   set auth redirect URLs, connect Vercel → verify sign-in on deployed URL (Phase 0 exit).
2. Phase 1: seed `taxonomy` from `01-Planning/blueprint-mapping.md` + JSON import script.
3. Phase 1: author ~3 original questions per discipline area; raw list page to verify.

## Stack (decided)
- Frontend: Next.js 14 App Router · TypeScript · Tailwind · shadcn/ui · PWA (manifest + SW)
- Backend: Supabase (Postgres + Auth + Storage), Row-Level Security per user
- Host: Vercel (frontend) + Supabase cloud
- Content: original questions authored to blueprint (see authoring guidelines) — NO real exam items

## Key constraints (do not break)
- **Integrity/copyright: all questions ORIGINAL.** Never use remembered/real NBDHE items.
  Sharing real items violates JCNDE rules of conduct — protects me and her. Non-negotiable.
- Target the **2026 "After Update" test specs** (Local Anesthesia broken out; update ~Oct 2026).
- Local-first feel but real accounts: offline study should work, sync when online.

## Repo / links
- Repo: https://github.com/EricTalanoa/Nbdhe_Prog.git
- Blueprint source: 00-Meta + 01-Planning/blueprint-mapping.md
- Board: 03-Kanban/board.md · Dashboards: 04-Dashboards/

## Decisions (locked)
- **Auth: magic link** (Supabase email OTP) — simplest for her, no password to manage.
- **Readiness: per-area % + a band** (Not yet / Approaching / Ready). No fake 49–99 scale number.
- **Perio charts: static images for MVP**, interactive charting deferred to Phase 7+.
- (Any of these can change — update here first, then the affected code.)

## Open questions
- None blocking Phase 0. Revisit readiness thresholds once real response data exists.
